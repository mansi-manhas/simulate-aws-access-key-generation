# Simulate AWS Access Key Generation

To simulate and automate interactions with a webpage like AWS settings page, I decided to use `Puppeteer` which can be used to automate interactions with a web page in a browser-like enviornment. 

Since as per the task we cannot use the AWS API lib.

# Libraries used

- Puppeteer

# Callout

We need to modify the code in future in case AWS decides to change the complete structure of their page
